            <p>
                My name is Ricardo, I'm from Van Nuys, California. I'm an artist in many facets of the meaning "artist".
                I'm currently pursuing my education as a Full-Stack Developer. Aside from that, I'm also the founder of
                the non-profit organization known as "The Fruitbat" which gives away free plants for residents of the
                San Fernando Valley. On top of that I make music. My most recent release is an EP named "The Beyond"
                which takes the skills I already had and built up more on them, hence the name the beyond.
            </p>
